            <p>Hi everyone! Welcome to my personal page. Here is a little paragraph about my life!</p>
            <p>I was born in Alameda CA in 1997. My family then decided to move to Guam when I was just six months old. Therefore, I was raised on Guam my whole life until 2019.</p>
            <p>On January 2019, I decided to leave my whole life behind on Guam and move to San Diego to start a new one. Life on Guam was not bad at all but I just got a little bored of the island and wanted to see what the rest of the world has to offer.
                It was the biggest and best risk I have ever taken. I do not regret my decision at all. </p>
            <p>It has been a year since I moved to San Diego and I am enjoing every second of it. I do admit that I spent my whole first year just partying out here and enjoying life but I knew I can not be partying forever. </p>
            <p>Fast fowarding to the year 2020 and I must say, it has been hectic with everything going on right now. I was in quarantine for two months due to the global pandemic. At first, I was not happy about it because I could not hang out with my friends
                or go to work. Then I started to focus on myself more during all the free time I had and realized that this is the perfect time to try something new and better myself. So here I am taking this bootcamp!</p>
            <p>I decided to take this coding bootcamp even though I had no coding experience. At first, I asked myself," Is this program legit or is it all a scam? How am I suppose to become a web developer in just three months?" Then I decided to just give
                it a try since I had nothing better to do during quarantine. At least I can learn something out of this other than just spending my days watching tv. Here I am now, creating my own website from scratch after just one week of class! So
                friends, this bootcamp is not a scam. If I can do it, you can too as long as you are dedicated. </p>
